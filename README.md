# serial-experiments-into-design

A series of short design experiments exploring UI elements, concepts, and interactions.  
Each experiment is represented by a HTML file that redirects to a specific design.

This project is a creative sandbox to:
- Explore new design ideas
- Prototype interface components
- Share micro-experiments in a browsable way
